# StudyShare

StudyShare is an app built to help students organize and study and share their flashcards for class! The user registers for an account using a unique username. They need only their username to log in. A user can create Subjects and add Flashcards for those subjects. Once flashcards have been populated, they can select a Subject and cycle through either all globally available flashcards or just their own flashcards to study.

## Installing

To install the app in your local environment:

1. Fork and clone both the frontend and backend repositories.
2. Load the repository in your favorite development software. I use Atom.
3. Run 'bundle install' in your terminal to install any uninstalled dependencies.
4. Run 'rails s' in your terminal to create a local environment to run the backend. Then open the 'index.html' file from the frontend repo in your web browser to begin using the app.
5. Some seed data is available to get you started.

## Resources

* Ruby on Rails - provides the MVC framework on the backend
* ActiveRecord - database manager
* PostGresSQL - database engine
* Fast JSON API - JSON serializer
* Rack-CORS - handles Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing to allow you to write to the db from the app frontend
* HTML/CSS - application layout and formatting.
* JavaScript - modifies the SPA view and sends requests to the backend to create/read flashcards, subjects and users.
